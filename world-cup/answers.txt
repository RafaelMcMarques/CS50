Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the variation among the results is high. In some cases, teams with low ratings ended up with high chances of winning.
Also, with up to 1000 simulations, Brazil and Belgium seemed to put up a fair fight for the highest probability, however, rising this number to 10000 and beyond
proved that BelgiumÂ´s odds were greather

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

From 10000 simulations the top part of the table had stabilized and just little variations among the teams in the lower part of it could be noticed.
