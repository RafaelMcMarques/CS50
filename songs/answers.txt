I would characterize the listener's audio aura as purple
I calculated this based on average values of danceability, valence and energy as well
as my personal knoladge regarding the songs and artists in the database.
Purple aura might not be representative of the listener since the valence
average is lower then you wold expect from someone who likes to be amped up
by music. Calculating the aura based on the discription given is hard, since
such discription is rather emotional and translating it into mathematical therms
is a subjective task. Therefore, in order to write code that calculates
the audio aura of a listener, a more precise definition of the
diferent types of auras should be stablished and only then a formula
for characterising a listener could be written.
